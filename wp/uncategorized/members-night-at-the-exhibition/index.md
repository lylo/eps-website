Around 60 members braved a wet and windy night to attend the Members’ Night at the Annual Exhibition.

[![people 2462](images/people-2462-300x224.jpg)](https://i0.wp.com/www.edinburghphotographicsociety.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/people-2462.jpg?ssl=1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; [![people 2460](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)](https://i0.wp.com/www.edinburghphotographicsociety.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/people-2460.jpg?ssl=1)

The Exhibition seemed to be well received, both the prints in the Main Hall, and the projected images shown on a continuous loop in the Digital Room.

Unfortunately Rikki O’Neill who judged the exhibition was unable to be with us to present the awards, and the presentations were made by Senior Vice-President Stephen Meek.&nbsp; Unusually almost all award winners were present to receive their trophies and certificates. Even more unusually, the choice of prints on the Popular Vote went to two images selected by Rikki!

Full details have been posted on the notice board at Great King Street.

Many thanks to all who were involved in this year’s exhibition – firstly to Terry Railley who handles the whole of the PI section, from collecting and collating all the images, sending them to Rikki, and then creating two slide shows – one with titles and authors’ names only, which was shown before the results were announced, and another with the awards listed, for display after the awards are announced. He set up the continuous loop slide show in the Digital Room.&nbsp; Terry has also set up the digital display in the Lobby for public viewing. &nbsp; Richard Bingham and Sandy Cleland put in a lot of effort on the print side of things, from collection, collating, and cataloguing, preparing spreadsheets etc, as well as being part of the expert team who assemble the exhibition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard (Hawkeye) also casts his eagle eye (sorry to mix my ornithological metaphors) over the catalogue entries.&nbsp; The exhibition itself involves setting up the 21 display boards, and mounting the 133 prints.&nbsp; The team was Richard, Sandy, John Wells, Davd Wolfenden, Jim Moir and Ian McNaught and we managed to get the whole exhibition up before lunch.&nbsp; Thanks also to June Scott for providing the refreshments – hot cups of tea, coffee and Jaffa Cakes being very welcome on such a cold night.

Thanks to Chick Calder for welcoming guests, and handing out catalogues and explaining the complex system for the Popular Vote – which involved writing two numbers on a voting slip!&nbsp; And to Alex Melrose, the Returning Officer, for counting the votes and being around doing all sorts of other, necessary jobs.&nbsp; And finally, my thanks to the volunteers who man the door on the two days when the Exhibition is open to the public, Jim Moir, Isobel Lindsay, Doug and Sue Hamilton, George Neilson, Sue Goode, and the crew who do the last stint, then remain to help take down the exhibition at 5pm on Sunday – you have all been mentioned already!

Now – come along to EPS on Wednesday 26 March to hear Rikki O’Neill explain his choices and discuss many of the other images too.&nbsp; He is an excellent speaker as well as judge, so it promises to be a very entertaining evening.

Neil Scott, Members’ Exhibition Secretary
