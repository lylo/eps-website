## History of the Edinburgh Photographic Society

Founded in 1861,&nbsp;Edinburgh **&nbsp;** Photographic Society was one of the first photographic societies in the world. Eminent early photographers, such as Octavius Hill ([Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Octavius_Hill)) were members and it is fair to say that EPS played a major role in the development of British photography.

We are fortunate that one of our members, Peter Stubbs (1945-2023) was a keen amateur historian and he created a very comprehensive web site recording the history of EPS (as well as other information about Edinburgh local history).&nbsp; Sadly, Peter’s web site was hacked in 2022 and badly corrupted. He was restoring this site when he died in December 2023.&nbsp;

Fortunately, there is a copy of Peter’s site ([edinphoto.org.uk](https://web.archive.org/web/20210228170231/http://www.edinphoto.org.uk/)) on the Internet Archive. We hope to restore much of this site but it is a huge undertaking and we don’t know when we might finish the work.

However, David Ferguson, another EPS member, has copied information from the web archive and has done a magnificent job in creating a printable copy of the history of EPS [(PDF download)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gfpbk247zet0sa5b0k29e/Peter-Stubbs-Edinburgh-Photographic-Society-V-25_01.pdf?rlkey=cs91i6kjnu5za8fi8htc5g8lo&dl=0).&nbsp;

On the occasion of EPS’s 150th anniversary, Peter wrote [a brief history of EPS](https://www.edinburghphotographicsociety.co.uk/wp/about/history/)
