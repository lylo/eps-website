## Exhibitions

Edinburgh Photographic Society organises international exhibitions of photography for prints and projected digital images and two annual members’ exhibitions.

The prestigious Edinburgh International Print Exhibition has been held annually since 1861. The Exhibition attracts entries from all over the world. The exhibition is on display in our Great King Street premises as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival each year. The 2025 exhibition, our 161st, is open to view at 68 Great King Street, Edinburgh, EH3 6QU from 2nd-24th August, 2025 (10:00-17:00). Entry is by fringe ticket **or** you may pay by card at the door. Your entrance fee includes a printed A4 full-colour catalogue of all accepted entries. Also on display will be two other exhibitions from Royal Photographic Society Members.&nbsp; Over 250 prints on display.

As well as the international exhibitions we organise two members’ exhibitions each year. Our annual members’ exhibition is held in our premises each April and an exhibition of members’ work is held in the Edinburgh Central Library in November.&nbsp;

We also regularly display guest exhibitions in our premises. These and are mostly for EPS members but may be open to the public.&nbsp; Examples of guest exhibitions include exhibitions of work by EPS photographers or exhibitions from photographic organisations such as the Royal Photographic Society.&nbsp; See the [EPS Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/EdinburghPhotographicSociety/) for news of guest exhibitions.
