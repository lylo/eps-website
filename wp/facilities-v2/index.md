## Facilities

Thanks to the foresight of EPS members in the early 1950s who bought an Edinburgh townhouse, we are fortunate to have a suite of rooms in a magnificent Georgian building in the heart of Edinburgh’s New Town. Within the building we have meeting and exhibition rooms, offices and a library and a well-equipped darkroom and studio.

Members may access and use the building at any time, unless it has been booked for a specific purpose.&nbsp;

## [Premises](https://www.edinburghphotographicsociety.co.uk/wp/premises-v2)

Find out about our premises at 68 Great King Street, Edinburgh.

## [Studio](https://www.edinburghphotographicsociety.co.uk/wp/studio-v2/)

All members, for a small annual fee, may use our well-equipped studio.
