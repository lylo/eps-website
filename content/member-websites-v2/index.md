Travel has been a long standing passion and, in photography, I look for the opportunity to gain a deeper connection with the places I have the privilege to visit.&nbsp; I enjoy exploring the world so come share my journey through the looking glass.

Myfloranova.com was a creative project born out of not being able to travel during the covid lockdowns. Something different and hopefully something that I will get back to work on again one day.
