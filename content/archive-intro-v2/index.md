## The EPS Digital Archive

EPS has decided to create an archive to collect and maintain paper and digital documents and images for the ‘unforeseeable’ future. That is, we don’t know who might be interested in the activities of EPS in 20, 30, 40, … years time so we aim to preserve what we can in the hope that it will be of interest to both current and future members.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The first stage of this process – the collection of digital documents and images to create a digital archive is now underway. Our aim is to make this available, on request, to members and others for historical research.&nbsp;

For practical and legal reasons, it is not possible to make our entire digital archive available through our public web site. However, to give members and others an impression of what’s in our archive, we have created this page as a gateway to some of the items that we hold. Some links are not yet active.
