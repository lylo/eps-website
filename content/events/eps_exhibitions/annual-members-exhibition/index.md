The Members’ Night of the exhibition on Friday 15 April brought around 50 members and guests to the Society.&nbsp; The trophies were presented to winners by Stephen Meek, President.&nbsp; On Saturday/Sunday 16/17 April the exhibition was open to the public but we had a mere 50 or so visitors.&nbsp; One of these was Doug Corrance who gave a talk to the Society on 20 January.&nbsp; He spent some time talking to those of us on the door, and took this photo – Neil Scott and Chick Calder at the table with Richard Bingham on the steps, all supervised by David Octavius Hill
