<p>The Members’ Exhibition will have its <strong>opening night and awards ceremony on Saturday 22nd April 2017, 5-7pm</strong> and will be open to the public on Sunday 23rd April. All submitted work will be displayed at Great King Street – the prints in the Main Hall, and the PDIs as a slide show in the Digital Suite. The judge this year is <strong>Hunter Kennedy EFIAP MAPGB</strong> from Carluke.</p>
<p>Twelve trophies are awarded in the print section and seven in the PI section together with a number of honourable mentions. Details are given within the Members’ Booklet on page 22.</p>
<p><strong> Closing date for entries is Wednesday 1st March.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each member can submit up to <strong>four prints and four projected images</strong>. The subject matter is open and both colour and monochrome are accepted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Prints</strong></p>
<p>Prints must be mounted on board, either window-mounted or flush-mounted with a maximum mount size of 40 x 50cm, although the actual print may be any size within these limits. Members are welcome to submit their prints as a panel. Please note, prints will be displayed as 2 x 2 (from top left to bottom right). The back of the print should show-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A – the title of the print</p>
<p>B – the author’s membership number</p>
<p>C – the author’s League status (1 or 2)</p>
<p>D – a title for the panel (if appropriate)</p>
<p>E – an indication of order to be displayed – 1, 2, 3, 4 (if appropriate)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Prints should be placed on the shelves in the Library, in suitable wrapping labelled clearly with your name and “For Members’ Exhibition” – but remember to put your membership number, not your name, on the actual prints.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please also submit a digital version (jpeg as below) to <a href="mailto:Stephen.Meek@yahoo.co.uk">Stephen.Meek@yahoo.co.uk</a>. This will be used by the judge to display winning entries on the opening night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p>PDIs must be JPEG, sRGB profile and should be 1920 pixels (maximum)</p>
<p>horizontally x 1200 pixels (maximum) vertically.</p>
<p>File names should follow the following convention: <strong>XX_nnnn_Image Title_1-4.jpg</strong></p>
<p><strong>XX=L1 or L2 (League 1 or League 2).</strong></p>
<p><strong>nnnn is your four digit membership number.</strong></p>
<p>Graham Morrice will collate the PDI entries. Please submit to <a href="mailto:comps@edinburghphotographicsociety.co.uk">comps@edinburghphotographicsociety.co.uk</a></p>
