    Edinburgh Photographic Society was founded in 1861 and has a long and illustrious history.

The primary historian of the society was the late Peter Stubbs whose project to document the history of the society led to the first fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society that was awarded for a website.

Sadly, Peter’s website was built using a now obsolete system and it was also damaged by a cyberattack in 2020. We are trying to retrieve as much as possible from this but this will clearly take some time.

Archive of [Peter Stubbs’s history website](https://web.archive.org/web/20180904165618/http://edinphoto.org.uk/4/4__eps.htm) on the Internet Archive. (external link)

David Ferguson, an EPS member, worked to recover part of Peter’s site in 2023.&nbsp;
