Members of EPS did very well in our own International Exhibition this year.

No less than ten members had a total of 19 acceptances (11 colur and 8 mono), which is almost 10 percent of the total.&nbsp; I haven’t done any research, but I suspect that this might be a record, certainly in recent years.

I suspect that some awards might have been given too, were it not for the ruling that EPS members are eligible only for the Edinburgh Medal.&nbsp; This year it was Neil Scott’s “turn” to win this medal.&nbsp; Karen Berry and Neil have alternated in winning this over the last four years!

A very interesting statistic is that this year, only 15 prints were accepted from countries other than Scotland, England and Wales.&nbsp; I am about to look at the statistics from the 2000 exhibition to the present day and will publish these as soon as I can.
