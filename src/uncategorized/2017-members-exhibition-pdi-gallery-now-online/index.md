Better late than never, for the first time we have a gallery of the PDI part of the 2017 members’ exhibition. See the Galleries menu to find it.

I’ve developed a more streamlined process to tag these with the correct title and author, which should speed up was a very tedious process, and one of the reasons for not doing this before.

To get an equivalent gallery of the Prints, we’d need everyone to send in matching, properly named, files for all their images.
