The London Salon, like our own International Exhibition, is one of the very few print-only exhibitions in the world.

We are therefore pleased to have a selection of prints from the exhibition on display in our Downstairs Gallery until the end of October.&nbsp; If you are interested in photography, please pop down some time and spend a while looking at these images.&nbsp; Some you may have seen in our own exhibition which shows that great minds think alike when it comes to appreciating the best in print photography.&nbsp; Our own Sandy Cleland is one of only two Scottish members amongst the 40-odd Salon members, and he has spent some time and effort getting these prints up to Edinburgh.&nbsp; _(Click on the image for a larger version)_

So make it worth his while and have a look one night when you are in the building.
