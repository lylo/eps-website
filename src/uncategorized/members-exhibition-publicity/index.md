As many members will be aware, our annual Members’ Exhibition will be on public view at Great King Street on 4th and 5th April.

To get as much publicity as possible, I have made up a flier which I would ask you all to download and print off.&nbsp; Then hand them out to local shops, libraries, community centres – any place where the general public might see them.&nbsp; Last year, if my memory serves me right, only around 70 – 80 people visited the exhibition over the two days.&nbsp; An enormous amount of work goes into the organisation of the Exhibition, and it would be gratifying if more people saw it.

So help the Society – please!
