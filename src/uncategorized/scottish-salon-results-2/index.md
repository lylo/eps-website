A number of EPS members enjoyed success at the Scottish Salon and the Society came second to Dumfries in the Club Awards which is an improvement on our third place last year. Thanks to all those who entered via the Club entry system.

Overall, we achieved 38 acceptances including a PSA Ribbon and 2 HM Certificates.
