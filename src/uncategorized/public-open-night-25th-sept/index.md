On Wednesday September 25th, we launch the start of the 2013-14 season with a public open night. If you were interested in finding out more about us, and maybe joining, this is your opportunity to come do so. There will be tours around the premises, you can check out the studio, darkroom and digital suite facilities, find out about what we do on Wednesday nights, and what the various sub-groups do.
