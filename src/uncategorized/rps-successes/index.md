**Phoenix Group** members have had considerable success at the September adjudications of the RPS distinctions panels.

**Jan Jerome, Richard Dyson** and **Ian McNaugh** t were all successful with their panels for the Licentiateship, while **Doug Berndt** was delighted with the success of his Associateship panel.

This is really quite an achievement for four members of the group to achieve their distinctions, and just goes to show what membership of the Phoenix Group can do for you!&nbsp; Mind you, the photographers themselves had something to do with it!

Congratulations to all four members, and to **Dave McCarthy** and **Mal Brown** who achieved their LRPS earlier in the year, (but before the new website was up and running).

Now, out of the 30 or so EPS members who come along to Phoenix Group Meetings, we have 8 LRPS, 6 ARPS and 7 FRPS members.&nbsp; The Phoenix Group is certainly living up to its unofficial motto – _ **“Taking your photography to a higher level”.** _
