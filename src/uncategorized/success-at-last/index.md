Members may be interested to hear the result of last week’s friendly battle (an oxymoron if ever there was one!) against Queen’s Park Camera Club in Glasgow.&nbsp; This is an annual event on a home/way basis, and this year it was our turn to be hosts.&nbsp; It is always a good social occasion and the result is less important than the exchange of comments and views on photography.

The competition is for 15 prints and 15 PDIs from each club.&nbsp; This year’s judge was [Duncan McEwan](http://www.dmcewanphotography.co.uk/) from Paisley Colour Camera Club.&nbsp; Duncan is an excellent judge, and his comments are always helpful.&nbsp; Wednesday night was no exception, and it is a shame that the event was attended by so few.&nbsp; Those members who did not attend certainly missed a masterclass.

The result?

Prints&nbsp; EPS 256&nbsp; QPCC&nbsp; 230

PDIs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EPS 255&nbsp; QPCC&nbsp; 234

The overall score was therefore 511 – 464 in favour of EPS.

The rather large margin of the win perhaps flatters EPS, but as Duncan said himself, there were excellent images from both sides.&nbsp; We are also pleased that no fewer than 29 members represented EPS, indicating the strength in depth of our club, and many of the images were from new members.
