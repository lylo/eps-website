**SPF CLUB DIGITAL KNOCKOUT CHAMPIONSHIPS**

On Sunday 16 November, the above competition was held at the former Stirling Management Centre, now re-named the Stirling Court Hotel.&nbsp; 28 Scottish clubs competed over three rounds of projected digital images.&nbsp; The format is that each club submits (in advance) a “bank” of 40 images, nominating eight of them as the first round entry.

After the scores for the first round are given, clubs nominate a further eight images as their second round entry.&nbsp; First and second round scores are then totalled and the top eight clubs, and any tieing for eighth place contest the final.&nbsp; The remaining clubs contest the Plate competition.

EPS narrowly missed reaching the final – by ONE point, and came third in the Plate competition.&nbsp; I have put up the score sheets on the[Phoenix Group](/groups/phoenix/ "Phoenix Group") page.

This is indeed a very disappointing result, and indicates that we must “pull our socks up” in February when the SPF Club Print champoionships are held.&nbsp; So we will be looking carefully at all the prints entered for our own internal competitions – and indeed the PDIs too.&nbsp; We might like to see a good quality print from a worthy PDI.
