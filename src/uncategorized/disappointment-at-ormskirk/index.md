EPS had a disappointing time at the PAGB Interclub Print Championships last weekend (25 October).&nbsp; The event was held for the first time at Edgehill University in Ormskirk, and the viewing facilities were certainly an improvement on Connah’s Quay.

In the first round we managed to score only 122 points from our 12 prints – a fraction over 10 points average – while Dumfries scored 157, an average of just over 13!&nbsp; To explain – three judges score each print from 2 to 5, making 6 the weakest and 15 the maximum.&nbsp; Any score of 13 or above means that at least one judge has given the maximum score, and to get an average mark suggesting at least one 5 per print takes some doing!

A difference of three points per image is a huge gulf, and we were well out of it this year.&nbsp; Mind you, we were in good (or is that bad?) company,as the three other Scottish clubs, Dundee, Carluke and Paisley Colour, also failed to reach the final, and joined us in in the Plate Competition.&nbsp; While Carluke won this consolation trophy, EPS were again way down the list.

And of course, congratulations to Dumfries for winning this prestigious trophyfor the second time.&nbsp; They previously won it in 2000.&nbsp; (EPS of course were equal first with the Arden Group in 2011, in case anyone forgets!)

This now means that if EPS is to go down to the PAGB competition next year, we will have to qualify as one of two clubs (apart from Dumfries) who come top in the SPF club print championships next February.&nbsp; There were some good images in last week’s first club print competition judged by Malcolm McBeath from Kirriemuir.&nbsp; So perhaps with some fresh talent we can improve our standing.

Let’s hope so.
