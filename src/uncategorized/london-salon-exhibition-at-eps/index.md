Sandy Cleland has set up a selection of prints which were accepted at this year’s London Salon in the downstairs gallery at Great King Street.

It will be on display until the end of October.&nbsp; All members, old and new, are invited to visit this exhibition which contains many superb prints. We are very privileged to host this exhibition and are one of only four venues in Britain to do so.

EPS does its very best to bring you the best of today’s photography – we have had our own International Exhibition during the Festival, which we trust that all members managed to visit at least once.&nbsp; The RPS Visual Art Group also had their annual exhibtion on display at the same time.&nbsp; Later this year we will have our annual exhange exhibition with the Dublin Camera Club, as well as a number of exhibitions from groups of the Society.

So don’t say you weren’t told!

&nbsp;
