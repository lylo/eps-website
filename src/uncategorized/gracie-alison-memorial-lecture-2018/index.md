What a great first talk we had from Margaret Salisbury, one of our honorary Vice-Presidents, on Wednesday 26th September evening. In a near full-house, the audience thoroughly enjoyed Margaret’s inspirational talk and images. There were significant learning points in the first half of Margaret’s talk that included images of some of the Welsh slate mines followed by some truly informative travel images of place and people in Ethiopia in the second part. This was billed as the Gracie Alison Memorial lecture and Gracie is remembered for her 40 years as Secretary of the Society. Gracie was instrumental in seeing EPS through some difficult times and helping to relocate us to Great King Street. Margaret knew Gracie well and chose to provide the tribute to Gracie in her own way. It was a great surprise that Margaret presented a portrait of Gracie, taken by Bill Wisden, a former Honorary Vice-President of the Society, who sadly passed away last year. The portrait will be hung in the newly refurbished library. It’s an excellent print, please take time to view it.
