FIAP (Fédération Internationale de l’Art Photographique) has announced the following distinctions awarded to members of EPS for success in entering exhibitions or salons in this country and abroad.  
**Eion Johnston** and **Terry Railley** have both achieved their EFIAP (Excellence of FIAP).&nbsp; This requires a minimum of 250 acceptances with at least 50 different images in 30 salons in 20 countries  
**Richard Bingham** and **Neil Scott** have achieved the EFIAP/s (Silver award)&nbsp; After achieving the EFIAP, there are 4 “levels” – bronze, silver, gold and platinum which must be attained sequentially.&nbsp; The bronze level requires 75 additional acceptances from 25 images, including three medals or other awards in separate countries.&nbsp; The silver requires a further 75 acceptances with a minimum of 25 new works, and 4 of these must have been awarded a medal or other award, all in different countries, on top of the three required for the bronze award.  
And finally **Peter Paterson** has been awarded his MFIAP (Master FIAP), the highest FIAP distinction.&nbsp; Unlike the other awards, this is for a portfolio of 20 prints and a curriculum vitae.&nbsp; The MFIAP is one of the most difficult distinctions to get, and I think I am right in saying that Peter is only the third Scottish photographer to achieve this goal.
