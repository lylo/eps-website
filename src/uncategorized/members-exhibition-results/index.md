Apologies for the delay in getting these published.

Those of you who were unable to hear Simon Allen’s discussion of the reasons for his choices missed a masterclass in judging!&nbsp; He is an excellent speaker and gives a very full assessment of an image’s qualities.

To see the winners – please click on the link [Trophy Winners 2015 kw](/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Trophy-Winners-2015-kw.pdf)

All trophies, including those for the Monthly Competitions are now with the Kirkwood’s, the engravers.&nbsp; Please be patient as Kirkwood’s are very busy at this time of year – the end of the football season etc etc so they have loads of engraving to do.&nbsp; When we have the trophies back, I will let you know.&nbsp; The most convenient time for collection will be on one of the Wednesday “unpacking nights” when we start opening the entries for our International Exhibition.&nbsp; But let me know when you intend to collect your trophy.

Neil Scott
