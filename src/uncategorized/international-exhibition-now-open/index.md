April 1st is All Fool’s Day, but it is no joke that the **152nd Edinburgh International Exhibition of Photography** opened for entries on that day.

The Edinburgh International is one of the world’s oldest photographic exhibitions, which accepts only prints.&nbsp; Indeed after recent changes in other salons we are one of only a very few exhibitions which does so.

You can enter up to four colour and four mono prints to this prestgious exhibition, and full details are found elsewhere on this website, or by going to[&nbsp;http://www.edinburghphotosalon.org/](http://www.edinburghphotosalon.org/)
