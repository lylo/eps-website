The Shortcuts menu is primarily aimed at regular website users who want to go directly to a specific page, such as the studio booking system. You should use the dropdown menus to access the page that you want.

If you have suggestions for other pages that might be added to the shortcuts menu, please [send us an email](mailto:webby@edinburghphotographicsociety.co.uk) with the URL of the page that you regularly access.
