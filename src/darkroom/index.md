For members interested in film photography, there is a darkroom with several enlargers for monochrome printing.

The darkroom contains three enlargers that can handle negatives from 35mm to 4×5 inch. There is also a 16×20 inch cascade print washer, a large heated bench for chemical trays, separate film and a negative drying cabinet.
