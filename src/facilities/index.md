## Facilities

Thanks to the foresight of EPS members in the early 1950s who bought an Edinburgh townhouse, we are fortunate to have a suite of rooms in a magnificent Georgian building in the heart of Edinburgh's New Town. Within the building we have meeting and exhibition rooms, offices and a library and a well-equipped darkroom and studio.

Members may access and use the building at any time, unless it has been booked for a specific purpose.
