EPS welcomed four members of Carluke Camera Club on 27 November to the annual interclub competition.&nbsp; The judge this year was Stan Farrow, FRPS EFIAP DPAGB from St Andrews Photographic Society.

EPS took the decision this year to allow each member only one image.&nbsp; This allows as many people as possible to have their work seen and judged against one of Scotland’s top clubs.&nbsp; This constraint of course was not imposed on Carluke and it is certain that some of their members had more than one image representing the club.  
Although we lost both Print and Projected Image sections, I think we can hold our collective head high.&nbsp; We came within 4 points of Carluke in the PI section, and although we lost the prints by an average of just under one point per image, this is still not a disgrace, considering that Carluke have a high reputation for the quality of their print workers.

NOW FOR QUEEN’S PARK!

Eagle-eyed (and possibly interested) members of EPS will have seen from the Members’ Booklet that we have our annual interclub match against Queen’s Park Camera Club in Glasgow on Thursday January 23 2014.&nbsp; Sandy Cleland is gathering together the fifteen prints and fifteen PDIs ready for sending off the QPCC.&nbsp; We have won this fixture the last two years, so let’s see if we can make it a hat-trick.

Three or four of us will be making the trip to Glasgow (it only takes an hour) to support EPS, and we would welcome anyone else who wishes to see another camera club, and meet its members.&nbsp; QPCC, like EPS, has its own premises (although perhaps not quite so grand as Great King Street).&nbsp; They are a very friendly bunch of photographers who would welcome an influx of Edinburghers to the match.&nbsp; If you are interested in forming another car-load, please contact [Sandy](sandy@cleland22.freeserve.co.uk) or [me](neil@neilscott.net).
