    The Edinburgh International is one of the most highly regarded photographic exhibitions in the UK, and one of the few Print only International Salons in the world. Our Exhibition attracts thousands of entries from all around the world.&nbsp;

Our Exhibition has built a strong reputation since its inception in 1861, the year Edinburgh Photographic Society was formed.

Unlike many exhibitions, we only accept what we can display thus, gaining an acceptance is a high achievement and much sought after by photographers who enter year after year. All accepted prints are displayed at Edinburgh Photographic Society’s premises during the Edinburgh Festivals in August when the exhibition receives thousands of visitors from all over the world, many of whom visit year after year. All accepted images appear in the A4 printed colour catalogue. We look forward to welcoming you to the 161st running of the Edinburgh International.

**This year’s Exhibition is open from 2nd to 24th August 2025 (10:00-17:00), you may pay by card at the door or purchase tickets via the Edinburgh Fringe box office. We&nbsp;****recommend that you give yourself at least 1-hour to view the works on display. A full colour A4 catalogue of around 50 pages showing all accepted prints in the international exhibition is provided as part of the entry fee.**

The competition is now open for entry!&nbsp; &nbsp;To enter go to our entry site [Enter the Edinburgh International Exhibition](https://edinburghprint.myphotoclub.com.au/) (hosted by MyPhotoClub.com.au)

We have no genres, entrants are allowed to enter up to 4 colour and 4 mono prints. All work must originate as original captures by light by the entrant.
