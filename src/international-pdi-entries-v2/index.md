    Edinburgh Photographic Society has a rich history, running one of the oldest Print Salons in the world since 1861. Following the success of our first and second International Digital Salons in 2021 and 2023, we now plan to run a third International Digital Salon in 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;

More information about the 2024 Digital Salon is available via the entry site here&nbsp;[https://eps.myphotoclub.com.au/](https://eps.myphotoclub.com.au/). Entries will open in August 2024.
