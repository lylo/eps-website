# ART AND DESIGN LIBRARY EXHIBITION 2015

The exhibition of EPS members' work is now up and running in the Art and Design Department of the Central Library, George IV Bridge (formerly the Fine Art Library). Many thanks to all who contributed – the response to our request for prints this year was excellent and we had plenty to choose from. Everyone who handed in their work to the EPS is represented and it is encouraging to see quite a few folk taking part for the first time. Now the work of 26 authors is on display. The exhibition looks good and with a variety of both very high standard and less experienced work to see, it will give our visitors an excellent overview of what the Society is all about – it is well worth a visit. We were getting favourable comments even as we were putting the prints up!

The Opening hours are Mon-Wed: 10am – 8pm, Thu-Sat: 10am – 5pm. The exhibition will run from Tuesday 3rd November until Saturday 28th November.
