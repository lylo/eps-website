# **FINE ART LIBRARY**

## **EPS EXHIBITION**

**_NOVEMBER, 2014_**

&nbsp;

**_PRINTS WANTED!_**

The Society holds an annual exhibition of members’ work in the Fine Art Library, George IV Bridge during the whole of November and we are now asking members to submit prints for this. We are looking for about 80 prints to fill the available space. Prints **must** be mounted on card and a minimum of 10 x 8 inches ( 25x20cm )&nbsp;&nbsp; maximum 20×16 inches (50x40cm) mounted, and can be of any subject.

It is open to all members, including new members and beginners, as we are trying to show the public a representative sample the sort of work we produce, the idea being to promote the Society. We usually have room to display about four prints per author but you can put in more or less as you wish. Prints don’t need to be your latest masterpieces, older works are perfectly acceptable. Everyone who contributes will have at least one of their prints displayed and we will show as many as there is room for.

The prints for this exhibition should be left on the labelled shelf in the rack in the library by Wednesday 29th October at the very latest, marked for “Fine Art Exhibition attn, of Doug and Sue” and must have your name on the back of the prints and on the packaging (not just the membership number) as name labels will be produced. It doesn’t matter what league you are in we welcome work from all members.The library produces posters for this exhibition which are circulated round Edinburgh libraries and the image used for these is usually picked from early entries so there is an incentive to hand your work in as soon as possible!

This is a good opportunity to have some of your work put on public display. If any member is wondering whether to enter or has any questions about it, feel free to ask Doug Hamilton, Sue Hill or in fact anybody wearing a label, for advice.
