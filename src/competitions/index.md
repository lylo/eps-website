We have an active programme of competitions, with four print and four projected image club competitions each year. These are judged by external judges who score and comment on images that members have submitted.

Competitions for both print and projected images are organised around two leagues. League 1 is for experienced photographers with formal photographic qualifications or who have participated in previous competitions and have received high scores. League 2 is for members who have not previously participated in EPS competitions or who have not reached the competition standard normally expected for League 1.&nbsp;

There are cups to be won for the winners of these two leagues.&nbsp;

The CD group and the Nature group also organise less formal competitions throughout the year – see the relevant webpages for more information about group competitions.

In addition, EPS participates in Scottish national photographic events and in inter-club compettions. We are always looking for members’ images that have scored highly in club competitions for these competitions.&nbsp;
