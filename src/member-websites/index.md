David Ferguson ([https://www.david-ferguson.com](https://www.david-ferguson.com/), [https://www.myfloranova.com](https://www.myfloranova.com/))
Travel has been a long standing passion and, in photography, I look for the opportunity to gain a deeper connection with the places I have the privilege to visit. I enjoy exploring the world so come share my journey through the looking glass.

Myfloranova.com was a creative project born out of not being able to travel during the covid lockdowns. Something different and hopefully something that I will get back to work on again one day.

A photographer specialising in wildlife, sport, landscapes, events and street photography – and travel when I can. My type of photography focuses on the world about us – in the moment. What excites me is capturing images which are impossible or very difficult to repeat -"a brief history in time".

Ian Sommerville ([https://iansommerville.com/myimages](https://iansommerville.com/myimages))
I became a photographer through my interests in hill-walking and the outdoors. I'm not a fan of the idea that images should speak for themselves and strongly believe that all images are improved with appropriate commentary.
