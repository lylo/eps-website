It was widely reported that the Prime Minister, The Rt Hon Theresa May MP, visited Edinburgh on the 7th August 2018 to sign the Edinburgh and S.E.Scotland City Deal and that she had taken the opportunity to experience some of the cultural events of the Edinburgh Festivals. We are pleased to say that one of the events attended by the Prime Minister was the 156th Edinburgh International Exhibition, currently on view at our premises until 26th August. Here is the Prime Minister being hosted by two Past-Presidents of the Society – Edith Smith, Chair of the 156th Edinburgh International Exhibition and Sandy Cleland Honorary VP EPS.
