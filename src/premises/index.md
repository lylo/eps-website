Edinburgh Photographic Society is fortunate to have its own premises at 68 Great King Street in the heart of Edinburgh's New Town. The Society bought these premises in 1954, funded by its members.

These building includes a large lecture hall, where most of our meetings are held, a large darkroom, a large studio, a second smaller studio, 2 exhibition rooms and a library, along with offices, kitchen and toilets.

There is a small garden that is used for social events in summer and may also be used as an outdoor extension to the studio.

Entry to the premises is available to members at all times, using an electronic key fob.

### The Main Hall

Our main meeting and exhibition room is a beautiful large room seating up to 80 people and is well equipped with a ceiling-mounted digital projector, large projection screen, amplification with an induction loop system, laptop, Slide projectors (35mm carousel and straight magazine, medium format), and print display easel with lights.

For exhibitions, we have a wall hanging system for around 200 50Ã—40 cm prints and good lighting.

### Location

68 Great King Street is a short downhill walk from Princes Street. There are several bus routes (8, 23, 27) that serve Dundas Street, which is a 3 or 4 minute walk from our premises. Car parking around Great King Street is paid parking during the day but free in the evening. However, it is often difficult to find a space.
