The Phoenix Group is an informal discussion group acting as a forum for people who are keen to develop their photography in ways such as the following:

- Creating a body of photographic work
- Entering external competitions to represent the Society
- Submitting work into photographic salons
- Achieving a photographic distinction

The meetings comprise of members bringing along their photography work, giving a brief statement of their aims and displaying the work for comment by those present. There will be members present who can offer their opinion based on their extensive personal experience.

There is no fee for this group and no particular membership criteria, but it is not a beginners' group and does not give instruction in basic photographic technique or equipment.
