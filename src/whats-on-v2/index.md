    Society meetings are held weekly throughout our session (September to April). During the summer, we have informally organised meetings and we normally take a break in August, when the International Print Exhibition is on display.

Full meetings are held on Wednesday evenings at 7.30 and some meetings are streamed on Zoom.

CD group meetings are held weekly on a Monday evening, Nature group meetings are held monthly on a Tuesday evening, Phoenix group meetings are held on a Thursday and Photo book group meetings are a mixture of Tuesday and Thursday evenings each month.

Studio beginners workshops are also held on a Tuesday evening.

Forthcoming meetings are shown in the calendar below.
