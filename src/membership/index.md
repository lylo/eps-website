## Membership

We welcome new members at any time, whether you are based in the Edinburgh area or elsewhere. We are not just a group of experienced photographers – our members have a wide range of experience from beginners to professional photographers. It doesn't matter what kind of camera that you use – whether its your phone or one of the latest DSLRs. We offer [opportunities to everyone](/learning/) to improve their photography.

If you join the Society, you can:

- Come along to any and all EPS meetings and other events and activities;
- Meet like-minded photographers, learn from others and improve your photography;
- Be inspired by the photography of our broad range of expert speakers;
- Participate in our sub-groups – Nature, Creative Digital, Photobook and Phoenix group;
- Access the studio and darkroom and attend workshops on how to use these facilities;
- Use our exhibition space to display your work;
- Enter the annual members exhibition where you can display your prints, digital images or AV presentations;
- Exhibit your prints in the Art and Design Library of Edinburgh Central Library with other EPS Members;
- Use our library to read our wide range of photographic books and borrow books to read at home;
- Add a link to your own photography web site from the EPS site.

If you are interested, you may come to any of our Wednesday meetings, listen to the speaker, and talk to members about the Society. Please let us know if you are coming so that we can make sure that someone is available to answer any of your questions. If you live outside Edinburgh, you may attend via Zoom – please contact the Membership Secretary who will arrange this.
