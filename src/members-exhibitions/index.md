Members' Exhibition are opportunities for members to show their work to other members and to a wider audience. We hold two members' exhibitions annually:

- The EPS annual members' exhibition is held in our clubrooms in spring. Members may submit prints, digital images and audio-visual presentations. Awards are made in various categories for prints, digital images and AV presentations. A full list of awards is included in our [member's handbook.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/j6f1ibxebxy9guiq22hsz/Syllabus-Final-version-ADB-post-print-1.pdf?rlkey=oypgvtcxq28sy7ogvivxc03e4&dl=0)
- The Central Library exhibition is held in the Edinburgh Art and Design Library on George IV Bridge in November. This is a print-only exhibition where members may submit up to four prints for public display
